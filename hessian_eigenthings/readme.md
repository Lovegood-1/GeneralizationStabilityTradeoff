# Files from Noah Golmant's PyTorch Hessian eigenvalue repository that we use to compute Hessian eigenspectra. A link to the repository and its README's introduction follow:

## pytorch-hessian-eigenthings

The `hessian-eigenthings` module provides an efficient way to compute the eigendecomposition of the Hessian for an arbitrary PyTorch model. It uses PyTorch's Hessian-vector product and stochastic power iteration with deflation to compute the top eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hessian.
